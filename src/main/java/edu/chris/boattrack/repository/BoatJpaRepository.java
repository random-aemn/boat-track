 * The method name, findByDeliveryZip(), makes it clear that this method should find all Order entities by matching their
deliveryZip property with the value passed in as a parameter to the method.
The findByDeliveryZip() method is simple enough, but Spring Data can handle
even more-interesting method names as well. Repository methods are composed of a
verb, an optional subject, the word By, and a predicate. In the case of findByDeliveryZip(), the verb is find and the predicate is DeliveryZip; the subject isnâ€™t specified and is
implied to be an Order
